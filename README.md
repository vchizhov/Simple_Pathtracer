# Simple_Pathtracer
A simple pathtracer that I did in my free time

Requires DirectX9.

I haven't included the other models(lucy, the dragon et.c) since they're relatively big. 

They can be found here: https://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/

A project I did in my free time trying to learn a few things. The project is far from finished and a bit of a mess, the pathtracer was inspired by Peter Shirley's series of books - Ray Tracing: In One Weekend, Ray Tracing: The Next Week, and Ray Tracing: The Rest Of Your Life. However it has little to do with how the code was organized and the techniques used in Peter Shirley's books,
as I tried to do everything from scratch. There's a doc (the papers used to make this project can be found in the literature) and a presentation also, since the project was used as part of a project in Software Technologies at FMI, the code was made only by me.
